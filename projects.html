        <h2 class="centered"> Research Projects</h2>
        <p> During my physics studies I had the pleasure of being involved in different research projects within the area of particle physics and its applications in medicine. 

        <br> <br>
        <b> <i> Anomaly Detection for New Physics searches with PIDForest</i></b>, CMS Collaboration of CERN, ETHZ, Zürich, CH
        <br> <br>
        
        <br> <br>
        <b> <i> &Psi;(2S) Discovery with CMS OpenData</i></b> <br>
        This was not a research project but a lecture project of
        <a href="https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=168145&semkez=2023S&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&lang=en">this</a> lecture, with the aim of teaching us statistical methds and analysis techniques used in high energy physics. The analysis project was based on python and made me more fluent in typical libraries used like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy but also more specialised ones like zfit and hepstats, introduced me to git but also on handling large data sets.
        The lecture was incredibly useful and I advice every student in Zürich, interested in experimental particle/astro physics to take the lecture.

        <b> <i> Limitation of phase-sorting based 4D dose calculation under irregular motion</i></b>, Center of Proton Therapy, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villingen, CH
        <br> <br>
        During my second year of bachelor studies, I heard about radiation therapy and its role of physics in it. Eager to learn more, I wrote an E-Mail to the 
        <a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/protontherapy#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20Center%20for,method%20worldwide%20for%20proton%20therapy.">Center of Proton Therapy</a> and asked wether they had opportunities for bachelor's student, and to my pleasant suprise, they offered semester projects! I then spent August-September, 2021, working on the phase-sorting algorithm used for dose calculation proton therapy applications. It was a computational project where I mainly used MATLAB but also got experience with the linux operating system and naturally also bash!
        The foundings of my projects were also published in a paper, where I co-authored on (which was incredibly exciting for me and still is): <br> <br>
        Duetschler, Alisha, et al. "Limitations of phase-sorting based pencil beam scanned 4D proton dose calculations under irregular motion." Physics in Medicine & Biology 68.1 (2022): 015015.

        <br> <br>
        <b> <i> Maintenance of the TAPS particle detector of the Mainzer Microtron</i></b>, Institute for Nuclear Physics, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Mainz, DE
        <br> <br>
        Within the first year of my bachelor studies, I had the opportunity to join the Krusche Group of the 
        <a href="https://wwwa2.kph.uni-mainz.de">A2 Collaboration</a> from the University of Basel to aid them in their maintenance of the TAPS detector, a forward wall detector. I spent a week there, in August 2020, assembling detector components and testing them for their functionality. Here I learnt a lot about detector physics, nuclear physics and radiation protection.

        <h3 class="centered">High School Experiences</h3>
        <p> My main subject in high school was biology and chemistry, where I spent 
            many hours in labs. Two experiences were particularly cool, where I could
            spend one week in a University lab:
            <br> 
            <br>  <b> <i>Vom Gen zum Protein (engl.: from the gene to the protein)</i></b>, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, DE
            <br> <br> 
            For one week in October, 2018, the biology teacher of my high school class went to the <a href="https://xlab-goettingen.de/en/">XLAB</a> (- Experimental Laboratory for Young People), which is located at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen. It was a very nice experience being in a biology lab for a week and learning a lot about genetics and I recommend it to STEM high school teachers.

            <br> 
            <br> <br>  <b> <i>Synthesis of macrocycles</i></b>, University of Geneva, Geneva, CH
            <br> <br>
            I signed up for one of the chemistry study weeks <i>(Studienwoche)</i> offered by <a href="https://sjf.ch/fr/">Schweizer Jugend forscht</a>. I spent a week in February, 2017, in a lab working directly with PhD Students within the Organic Chemistry Department of the University of Geneva. It was an interesting experience and I do recommend any Swiss high school student interested in STEM to just apply to one of their study weeks.
